# Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Churn prediction is a crucial task in the telecommunications industry to identify customers at risk of leaving. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to predict churn and analyze customer retention strategies.

## Code

The code folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Dataset

The data folder holds the dataset (`Telecom_Churn_Prediction.csv`) used for training and testing the machine learning models. This dataset includes various customer features and churn labels.
